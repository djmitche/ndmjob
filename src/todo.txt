Things to add:

- Make sure after a backup or restore run that record count for the
  mover and byte count for both MOVER and DATA are positive after the
  STOP.... Better yet...positive and larger or same
  then the last successful query.

- During backup does DATA have to notify *before* MOVER during a normal
  backup?

- Add 1/8 hour timeout to lack of progress with record number for MOVER
  Ditto for DATA?

- Make sure byte count/record counts for MOVER and DATA are going staying
  the same or increasing.

- 5 minute timeout on commands (probably 4 minutes)

- In v3 & v4, MOVER can can CONNECT to DATA (instead of the normal
  DATA connect to MOVER).

- Make a cons file so it builds correctly especially if data structures
  change....

- Add state checks and the like to '-c' and '-x' mode so we can detect
  failures.....!!!!

- Add variations of -c and -x to expect failures and confirm them.

- Display for -c and -x notifications and final state at end and
  make sure they are all positive or negative final with at least
  one negative notification.

- Add graceful connection closing with check....

- Add batch command set mode so multiple operations such as a 
  backup followed by a restore using the same sessions/connections can
  be done....

- Add switch for adding EOFs at EOM (on mover PAUSE EOM)

- Fix this loop on a closed TCP connection:
  #D   0:00:49.183 ERR=xdr-get-next
  SESS 0:00:49.183 ch name=#C. resident ready=0 avail=0 
  SESS 0:00:49.183 ch name=#D readchk -rdy-chk-eof
  SESS 0:00:49.206 ch name=image-stream idle 
  #D   0:00:49.206 ERR=xdr-get-next
  SESS 0:00:49.206 ch name=#C. resident ready=0 avail=0 
  SESS 0:00:49.206 ch name=#D readchk -rdy-chk-eof
  SESS 0:00:49.215 ch name=image-stream idle 

- Make sure there is tests for 80-byte ANSI style tape and file records.

- Add direct access TCP WRITER test to MOVER.

- Add direct access TCP READ test to MOVER with optional DAR like activity.

- Add direct accesss TCP sink test to DATA.
